# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector-with-IoT-integration
### IoT tools required:
+ Arduino UNO board
+ servo motor
+ Jumper wires

1. Download the zip file or you can clone the repository.
2. Open CMD prompt and type
`python3 detect-mask-video.py`
1. If you get any error install those package and most probably all the errors will be cleared.
1. And make sure to connect arduino before running the above command. And change the COM port number in controller.py file by looking into device manager that which port is being used.
3. Now you get a video stream in a minute which identifies weather you wear mask or not.
4. According to that the servo motor opens and closes(rotates).
5. That's it, Happy building:))

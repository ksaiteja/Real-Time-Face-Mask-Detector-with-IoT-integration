# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector-with-IoT-integration
### IoT tools required:
+ Arduino UNO board
+ servo motor
+ Jumper wires

1. Install all the requires packages.
2. Then in CMD prompt type
`python3 detect-mask-video.py`
3. Now you get a video stream in a minute which identifies weather you wear mask or not.
4. According to that the servo motor opens and closes(rotates).
5. That's it, Happy building:))
